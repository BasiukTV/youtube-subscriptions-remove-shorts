# How To Use
* Just load the whole folder unpacked into Chrome Extensions (Developer mode has to be On).

## Disclaimers
* This worked as of 03/02/2023, but will probably eventually break.
* This extension is not particularly efficient, I only spent a few hours on this and generally not that good at JS.
